## üí° Background and solution

I am using the group by feature approach for folder structure which helps me find related files easily.

Below is the component hierarchy overview.

```mermaid
flowchart TB
  editor-->editor-provider
  editor-provider-->image-group
  editor-provider-->code-block
  subgraph unuploaded
    image-dropzone
  end
  subgraph uploaded
    image-canvas
    image-selection
  end
  image-group-->unuploaded
  image-group-->uploaded
```

### Why use the context provider pattern

- It's not a complex state, Most of the re-render is necessary when the state change.
- Friendly for component composition. Keep the exposed context API consistency to help alternate the sub-component or better implementation easily.

If resize or reposition the selection block needs to renew the preview data immediately, Maybe can split the context or use the state management library for the performance issue.

### Canvas

- Most of the canvas view updates do not rely on react manipulate, so I use `useRef` to keep the canvas internal state, e.g. mouse current status.
- Saving the latest canvas DOMRect via mousedown and use in mousemove, avoid get box metrics frequently (might cause unnecessary reflow).

### Libaraies

- react-dropzone: For file upload, prop getters API looks good to me.
- react-rnd: It's a higher-level wrapper of react-draggable and re-resizable combination, I think the API interface is easy to use.
- react-icons: Styling.
- styled-components: Styling.
- polished: CSS-in-JS toolset. use for setup the normalize CSS.
- nanoid: Unique string id for selection block.
